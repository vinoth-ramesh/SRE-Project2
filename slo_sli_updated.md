| Availabilty  | The proportion of successful requests for the last two days                                                                                                    | 99%                                                                                                         |
| Latency      | Shows the latency numbers that are n the top 90% of requests over the last 5 minutes                                                                           | 90% of requests below 100ms                                                                                 |
| Error Budget | Our error budget is 20% meaning that we want 80% of our requests to be error-free. Calculate the precentage remaining of our error budget over the last 7 days | Error budget is defined at 20%. This means that 20% of the requests can fail and still be within the budget |
| Throughput   | We would like to know the RPS (requests per second) for successful requests to the apiserver over 5 minutes                                                    | 5 RPS indicates the application is functioning                                                              |
